1. `Leet code: In-order Java Iteratpr <https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/solution/>`_ -- source code and explanation. This is very good.
2. `Virginia Tech: Iterating over a Tree Structure <http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3114/Fall17/barnette/notes/Tree-Iterators.pdf>`_  -- contains Java in-order and post-order stack-based iterators.
3.  Carneige Mellon: Trees:
    * The Binary Trees `lecture <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/trees.html>`_ discusses implementing a Pre-Order iterator class in Java.
    * The source code is `here <https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Trees/code/BST.java>`_. It includes the nested Pre-Order Java iterator class.
