Implement and test stand-alone iterative method for post-order and pre-order traversals. Implement and test a postorder_stack_iterator. 

BUG in DoPostOrderIterative(). Infinitie loop.

Finish code to accurate set the recursion depth for ~bstree() and ~Node(), or use the debugger to follow the ~Node() calls to see how deep the recursion goes.
