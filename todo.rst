TODO 
====

The new code is in bst-key-value.h, remove() is not yet implemented. The algorithms all follow the book Introduction to Algoritms by Cormen, et. al. -- and the helper transplant() method -- that are givin starting on page 295 of Introduction to Algorithms.

Other General Comments
----------------------

1. First, prove that using shared_ptr causes state/nodes to be shared, so we can't have any methods that return Value& or pair<const Key, Value>&, and we can't do things like 'map[some_key]++, say. Prove that this is true for
2. Trace the Node copy ctor and assignemnt ctors to confirm them operation.
3. Study std::map then add the other insert methods, after I understand them.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <iostream>
    #include <map>
    #include <string>
     
    int main()
    {
        std::map<std::string, std::string> myMap;
        myMap.insert_or_assign("a", "apple"     );
        myMap.insert_or_assign("b", "bannana"   );
        myMap.insert_or_assign("c", "cherry"    );
        myMap.insert_or_assign("c", "clementine"); // <--- Overwrite value at key "c", changing tree.
     
        for (const auto &pair : myMap) {
            std::cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << '\n';
        }
    }
    
See also the std::map methods ``T& operator[]( const Key& key );`` and ``T& operator[]( Key&& key );`` that also return reference to the value, ``T&``, at ``key`` from

shared-bst.h and unique-bst.h use shared_ptr and unique_ptr, respectively.

TODO
----

1. Prove that using shared_ptr causes state/nodes to be shared, so we can't have any methods that return Value& or pair<const Key, Value>&. See code above.,
2. Use __value_type from value-type.h in bst.h, and test it, check the logic.
3. Add the std::map methods that are missing like emplace() and insert_or_assign().
4. Migrate the __value_type() solution to the tree23 code and tree23.
5. Write up in ~/c/tree23 and ~/c/tree234 why unique_ptr is preferred over shared_ptr and comment on the implementation, say, of Node() class and __value_type's use. 

TODO: Use the include/value-type.h code extracted from /usr/lib/llvm-9/include/c++/v1/map. 
or using this:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // types:
    typedef _Key                                     key_type;
    typedef _Tp                                      mapped_type;
    typedef pair<const key_type, mapped_type>        value_type;
    typedef value_type&                              reference;
    typedef const value_type&                        const_reference;


shared_ptr use and issues
-------------------------

Using shared_ptr<Node> improves efficiency, but causes problems (see below). For example, when we copy a tree, we only have to copy a shared_ptr, but there is a drawback. For the details see:

* `C++11 Smart Pointer Tutorial Series: Part 1 of **shared_ptr Tutorial and Examples** <https://thispointer.com/learning-shared_ptr-part-1-usage-details/>`_
* `C++11 Smart Pointer â€“ Part 5: shared_ptr, Binary trees and the problem of Cyclic References <https://thispointer.com/shared_ptr-binary-trees-and-the-problem-of-cyclic-references/>`_
* `Implementation of Binary Search Trees ViaSmart Pointer <https://thispointer.com/shared_ptr-binary-trees-and-the-problem-of-cyclic-references/>`_
* `Exploring std::shared_ptr <https://shaharmike.com/cpp/shared-ptr/>`_

Questions about the first article:

* What is the fundamental issue with the 'parent' pointer?

* Can the issue be solved by simply using a raw pointer instead of a using weak_ptr, or is weark_ptr necessary to ensure memory is properly managed in trees? 

.. todo:: Once I have the answer, add the reasoning to the 'binary search tree' text. Same with 2-3 trees and 2-3-4 trees. And ultimately red-black trees

* Why does weak_ptr exist, what does doe it do exactly, and when must it be used?

* What are the issues with shared_ptr in terms of its effect on not managing memory properly?
  
A: Currently copy_tree creates new nodes on the heap offering no advantage over unique_ptr. There is a design problem with using shared_ptr, too. If we share nodes between trees, an update to a node's Values (which
can be returned by reference using 'map[some_key]') will be reflected in any other tree created as a copy. 

.. todo:: Test the above and verify it, then implement or revert to a unique_ptr version.
