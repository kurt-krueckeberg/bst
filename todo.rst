The nested inorder_stack-iterator seems to be working. Examine include/sources.rst and implement and test a preorder_stack_iterator and postorder_stack_iterator.
 
Implement stand-alone iterative versions, too. 

Finish code to accurate set the recursion depth for ~bstree() and ~Node(), or use the debugger to follow the ~Node() calls to see how deep the recursion goes.

Read up on measuring recursion in Carrano, Droznek, and see `Time Complexity of Resursive Algorithms: The Master Theorem <https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/time-complexity-recursive-functions/>`_
